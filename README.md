ML Internship at [Prodigy InfoTech](https://prodigyinfotech.dev) 



**Overview:**
Welcome to the Customer Segmentation repository, where we leverage the K-means clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their purchase history. This project aims to uncover patterns and segments within customer data to aid in targeted marketing and personalized customer engagement strategies.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Mall Customer Segmentation Data. It includes both Training and Testing data, providing comprehensive information about customers' demographics and purchasing behaviors.

**Techniques:**
The primary technique employed in this project is K-means clustering. This algorithm partitions customers into distinct groups (clusters) based on similarity in their purchase patterns. It helps in identifying meaningful segments of customers for tailored marketing strategies and improved customer retention efforts.

**Purpose:**
This repository serves as a demonstration of applying K-means clustering for customer segmentation in retail analytics. By exploring and clustering customer data, we aim to extract valuable insights that can optimize business strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.
